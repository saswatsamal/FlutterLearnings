- In this part, I've made the app to look better using Material Scaffold.
  
- I also what are Stateless and Stateful Widgets.

    - Stateless: Basically it is static i.e. never changes, like Icon, Icon Button.
    - Stateful: It is dynamic like Checkbox, Slider etc.

- In this app I've done the project using <code>Stateless Widget</code>
